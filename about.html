  <div class="cell cell--auto">I am an Adviser in the Prices and Costs Division at the Directorate General Economics of the European Central Bank. I started my career at the ECB in 2000, after my PhD studies at the European University Institute. 
After working many years on exchange rates, trade and competitiveness I now work on inflation. After leading the macro workstream of the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-research/research-networks/html/researcher_compnet.en.html">competitiveness research network CompNet</a> I coordinated the work of expert groups of the European System of Central Banks on <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecbop181.en.pdf">low inflation (2017)</a> and <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op241~c7c3080d60.en.pdf?94a6f35fa4d75046167801a4bb8a467c">exchange rate pass-through (2019)</a>. I am now one of the coordinators of the new Price Setting Microdata Analysis (PRISMA) research network.
